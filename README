The Java Trusted Native Client (jtnc) project is a proof of concept attempt at 
creating a generic and flexible native client architecture for web applications.  
The intent is to provide a generic Java application framework that allows web 
applications to access pre-configured extensions with trusted access to the 
client machine.  Once a sastisfactory level of functionality has been acheived, 
the goal is to move this bare-bones project to a proper Java application framework 
and get a beta version working with some live test cases.
