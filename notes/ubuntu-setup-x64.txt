- Install the getlibs utility located at jtnc/archive/getlibs-all.deb

- Locate the xulrunner package you have installed and use getlibs to
  download the 32-bit version.  For example, if your package is named
  xulrunner-1.9.2, you would need to run the command:
  getlibs -p xulrunner-1.9.2

- Now that we have a new version of xulrunner for x32, we need
  to point the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME environment variable to it.
  You can create a custom launcher for eclipse that exports
  this value locally when running the IDE, or go ahead and set
  the env variable up globally.  As long as eclipse can see it,
  it should work.  Example:
  export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib32/xulrunner-1.9.2.24

- Create the folder /usr/lib32/jini if it doesn't already exist.
  Copy all of the files in jtnc/archive/libswt-gtk_x32/ to this
  new jini folder.

- Run the followings commands to obtain various 32-bit versions
  of libraries Mozilla browser will need:
  getlibs -l libxcb-atom.so.1
  getlibs -l libxcb-event.so.1
  getlibs -l libxcb-aux.so.0
  getlibs -l libstartup-notification-1.so.0
  getlibs -l libhunspell-1.2.so.0
  getlibs -l libxpcom.so
